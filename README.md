Capstone Project

Capstone Project Repository
This repository contains the capstone project for the Imperial College Professional Certificate in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence. The project showcases the end-to-end application of ML/AI techniques—starting from data exploration and culminating in model development, evaluation, and deployment.

Project Overview
This section will be updated to include details about the dataset, business problem, or research question addressed in the project.

The primary objectives of the capstone project are to:
1. Apply machine learning and AI concepts learned throughout the programme
2. Work with real-world or simulated datasets
3. Demonstrate skills in model development, optimisation, and evaluation
4. Clearly document methodologies and results for sharing with peers and potential employers

Tools & Technologies
1. Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
1. NumPy, pandas – for data manipulation
2. scikit-learn, PyTorch – for machine learning and deep learning
3. Environment: Jupyter Notebook – for experimentation and reporting
4. Version Control: Git/GitHub – for collaboration and code management

Project Workflow
1. Define the problem and success criteria
2. Acquire and prepare the dataset
3. Explore and visualise the data
4. Build baseline models
5. Improve models using advanced techniques (e.g. optimisation, regularisation, deep learning)
6. Evaluate models using relevant metrics
7. Summarise results and insights in a final report

Next Steps
1. Finalise the problem statement
2. Select and obtain the dataset(s)
3. Begin exploratory data analysis (EDA)
